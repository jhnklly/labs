Notes:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you download your health or visit summary documents, several files are compressed into a single ZIP file so they can be transferred quickly. You need to uncompress (unzip) this file before you can view your documents. Refer to steps below for uncompressing your download.

A PDF file was included with your download and provides the easiest way to view the contents of this document. Your download also includes a file called INDEX.HTM which allows you to view the contents. To open the INDEX.HTM file, unzip the entire download and then double-click to open it. Note that this file will not display properly if you double-click the copy in the zip. The download also includes a number of data and support files. These files let other healthcare software applications understand the data in the documents.

If you chose to encrypt your download, it will only remain encrypted until you unzip it. To continue protecting your data when you are done viewing it, locate the unzipped folder and delete it.
